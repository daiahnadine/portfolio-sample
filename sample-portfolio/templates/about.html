    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Aiah Nadine Q. Delos Reyes, a 21-year-old aspiring developer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Rogationist College. As an incoming fourth-year student, I have developed a strong passion for web development, both in front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, I've immersed myself in various aspects of web development. On the front-end, I enjoy creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that a well-designed front-end is crucial for enhancing user experience and engagement.</p>
    <p>On the back-end, I have extensive experience working with Java, Spring Boot, Oracle DB, PHP, and MariaDB. I have developed robust and efficient back-end systems using Java and Spring Boot, leveraging their powerful features and libraries to create scalable and maintainable applications. My proficiency with Oracle DB allows me to design and manage complex databases, ensuring data integrity and performance. Additionally, I have worked with PHP and MariaDB to build dynamic web applications, utilizing PHP's server-side scripting capabilities and MariaDB's relational database management system.</p>
    <p>While I have a strong background in Java, Spring Boot, Oracle DB, PHP, and MariaDB, I am also beginning to explore Python for back-end development. I am excited about the flexibility and simplicity that Python offers, and I am eager to expand my skills in this area.</p>
    <p>In addition to my technical skills, I have experience working as a product owner or business analyst in our class project. In these roles, I have been responsible for gathering and analyzing requirements, managing product backlogs, and ensuring that the development team delivers high-quality features that meet user needs. My experience in these positions has honed my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, manage project timelines, and deliver successful projects.</p>
    <p>I am a quick learner and always eager to expand my knowledge. I am constantly exploring new technologies and tools to stay updated with the latest industry trends. My ability to adapt and my dedication to continuous learning have helped me to successfully complete various projects and contribute to collaborative team efforts.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, I am a creative thinker. I enjoy taking on new challenges and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. I am also an effective communicator and enjoy working in team environments where I can share ideas and learn from others.</p>
    <p>As I move forward in my career, I am excited about the opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world projects, contribute to the tech community, and continue growing as a developer and a professional. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.</p>
